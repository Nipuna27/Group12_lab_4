## Objective
The main objective of this lab is for you to develop a small water level controlling system of a water tank using the knowledge of interrupts and other programming techniques of PIC16f877a from all the labs we did throughout the course. 

## Apparatus
- 12v-5v convertor (7805)
- 22pf capacitor 
- 20MHz crystal
- 10k, 330ohm resistor 
- Diode
- L293d motercontroller 
- Pic16f877a
- 100uf capacitor 
- 12v input jack
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Motors


## Task
Below is a water tank that has two DC motors where the motor one is used to pump the water into the tank the motor two is used to suck the water out from the water tank and there are three sensors that are used to measure the water level of the tank. The operations of the two DC motors according to the switch state is given in a table right after the diagram.
